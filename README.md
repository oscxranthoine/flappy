Flappy Bird - Project Description

This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game, developed using the Pygame library. 
The game was created as part of my final year project in the NSI (Num√©rique et Sciences Informatiques) specialization. 
Players control a bird and navigate it through gaps between pipes by pressing a key to make the bird flap its wings. 
The objective is to avoid colliding with the pipes and score points by successfully passing through them. 
This project demonstrates key concepts of game development in Python, such as collision detection, event handling, and real-time graphics rendering with Pygame.
